====== RESTful design ======
Created Friday 09 August 2019


"RESTful" refers to a way of laying out different html requests. 

HTML requests include a 'html header' and a 'html body'. 
The header can be GET/POST/PULL/PUT/DELETE.
The data can be anything.

Restul is an attempt of standardising what a request looks like.

The basic idea is that the HTML header should describe what the request does. GET should never write data, DELETE should delete that record, PUT should update a piece of data. Some people are very strict with these, some people don't really care, and they just use POST for everything (but that isn't really "RESTful").

For example, here is a list of commands:

POST www.url.com/users/new
POST www.url.com/users/new
GET www.url.com/users/1
GET www.url.com/users/2
GET www.url.com/users/1/friends
PUT www.url.com/users/1/
	{
		"name": "max"
	}
POST www.url.com/users/1/friends/2
